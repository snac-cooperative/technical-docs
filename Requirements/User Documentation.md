# User Documentation

Every aspect of the system requires documentation. Most visible to the public is the user interface for
discovery. Maintenance will be complicated, and our processes are somewhat novel, so this will need to be
extensive, well illustrated with screenshots, and carefully tested.

Documentation intended for developers might be somewhat sparse by comparison, but will be critical to the
on-going software development process. All the databases, operating system, httpd and other servers need
complete documentation of installation, configuration, deployment, starting, stopping, and emergency
procedures.
