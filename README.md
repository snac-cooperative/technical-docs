# Documentation

Quite a bit of documentation is found on the Wiki. (See the "Wiki" menu on the left nav bar.)

The currently-being-revised TAT requirements are found here in the [tat_requirements](tat_requirements).

Note for TAT functional requirements: need to have UI widget for search of very long fields, such as the Joseph Henry cpfRelations
that contain some 22K entries. Also need to list all fields which migh have large numbers of values. In fact, part of the meta data for
every field is "number of possible entries/reapeat values" or whatever that's called.
