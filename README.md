# SNAC Documentation

This repository contains all the documentation for the SNAC Web Application and related frameworks, engines, and pieces.  Specifically:

* The currently-being-revised Technical Requirements are found in the [Requirements Directory](Requirements).  
* Formal Specifications for those requirements are in the [Specifications Directory](Specifications).
* [Help](Help) on using Gitlab, Git, and the Markdown text format
* [Documentation](Third Party Documentation) on third-party software and applications being used
* [Historical Documentation](Historical Documentation) on previous iterations of SNAC
* Technical [Discussions](Discussion) related to the SNAC project
* [Notes](Notes) from the technical team.
* Database schema diagrams auto-generated by SchemaSpy http://shannonvm.village.virginia.edu/~twl8n/schema_spy_output/

The best place to start is the big, overall [plan](plan.md) document, which describes the process forward with defining requirements and specifications.

This repository is stored in Gitlab, a work-alike clone of the Github web site, but installed locally on a SNAC server. Gitlab is a
version control system with a suite of project management tools.

Ideally we will all create documentation in [markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (.md files). You may create and edit files from
the web interface here on Gitlab, or download files and edit locally. You can also upload any file type using
standard git commands, or use a Git graphical client (see below). Choose a relevant directory for your docs,
or create a new directory as necessary.  

Markdown files are simple text files, which makes them easy to edit and universally portable. Markdown has a
limited set of conventions to denote headers, lists, URLs and so on. When uploaded to gitlab or github,
markdown files are rendered into nicely styled HTML. Tools are available to convert markdown into .doc, .pdf,
LaTex and other formats. For more information on Markdown, see [this guide](Help/Markdown.md).
