# Documentation

Documentation is best created as files (preferrably markdown format) in the repository, and in a relevant directory.

Some documentation was created in the Wiki, but will be moved to files. (See the "Wiki" menu on the left nav bar.)

The currently-being-revised TAT requirements are found here in the [tat_requirements](tat_requirements).
