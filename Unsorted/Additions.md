#### Brian's API docs need to be merged in or otherwise referred to:

[https://gist.github.com/tingletech/4a3fc5f59e5af3054286](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Ftingletech%2F4a3fc5f59e5af3054286&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEJeJexryBtHbvLw-WtFYjxP4VwlQ)

#### Not sure where to fit these topics into the requirements. Some of them may not be part of technical requirements:

Discuss. What is "as it is configured now"? Consider implementing linked data standard for relationship links
instead of having to download an entire document of links (as it is configured now.)

Discuss. This seems to be the controlled vocabulary issue. Sort by common subject headings across all of SNAC - right now SNAC has
subject headings that have been applied locally without common practice
across the entire corpus.

We probably need to build our own holdings authority.

We need to write code to get accurate holdings info from WorldCat records. All the other repositories will
have be handled on a case-by-case basis. Sort by holdings location. Sort by identity's activity location. Sort
and visualize a person through time (show dates for events in a person or organization's lifetime). Sort and
visualize an agency or organization as it changes over time.

Continue to develop and refine context widget.

Sort collection links. Add weighting to understand which collections have more material directly related to
identity. (How is this best handled programmatically or as an input by contributors- maybe both?).

Increase exposure of SNAC to general public by leveraging partnerships.  Suggested agreement with Wikipedia to
display Wikipedia content in SNAC biographical area and work with Wikipedia to allow for links to SNAC at the
bottom of all applicable identities. This would serve to escalate and drive traffic to SNAC.
