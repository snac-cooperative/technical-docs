- how is gitlab backed up?


Overview and order of work
---


1. create tech documents, filling in as much prose as possible

1. create prototype software to test tech requirements, iterate updating requirements and prototype

1. create tests for test driven development, and validate prototype

1. refactor or rewrite prototype to match requirements

1. create version 1 of software


Code we write
----

- Identitiy Reconciliation (aka IR) (architect Robbie)

 - needs docs wrangled

- workflow manager (architect Tom)

  - exists, needs tests, needs requirements
  
- SQL schema (Robbie)

  - exists, needs tests, needs requirements

- CPF to SQL parser (Robbie)

  - exists, needs tests, needs requirements
  
- Name string parser

- Date parser

- coding style, class template (architect Robbie)


Code we use off the shelf
---

- gitlab for docs, code version management, issue tracking(?)

- github public code repository?

- test framework, need to choose one

- authentication

- reports, probably Jasper

- PHP, Postgres, Linux, Apache httpd, etc.
