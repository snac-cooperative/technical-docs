Big questions
---

- how is gitlab backed up?


Overview
---


- create tech documents, filling in as much prose as possible

- create prototype software to test tech requirements, iterate updating requirements and prototype

- create tests for test driven development, and validate prototype

- refactor or rewrite prototype to match requirements

- create version 1 of software


Code we write
----

- Identitiy Reconciliation (aka IR) (architect Robbie)

 - needs docs wrangled

- workflow manager (architect Tom)

  - exists, needs tests, needs requirements
  
- SQL schema (Robbie)

  - exists, needs tests, needs requirements

- CPF to SQL parser (Robbie)

  - exists, needs tests, needs requirements
  
- Name string parser

- Date parser

- coding style, class template (architect Robbie)


Code we use off the shelf
---

- gitlab for docs, code version management, issue tracking(?)

- github public code repository?

- test framework, need to choose one

- authentication

- reports, probably Jasper

- PHP, Postgres, Linux, Apache httpd, etc.
