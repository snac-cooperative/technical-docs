##### Constellation diagrams

The diagrams show conceptual table names, which mirror the SQL database schema. An identity
has one record in each table unless noted as repeatable.

constellation_linked.gv.svg is an over view showing how two related records are linked via identity
relation. Each record is independent. The only link between records is the identity relation which had one
record for each side of the relationship. For reasons of clarity, the two identity constellations are not
shown in full detail.

identity_constellation_repeats.gv.svg is a detailed view of a single identity constellation with repeatable
recorda noted.

identity_constellation.gv.svg is an earlier, simplified view of the data.
